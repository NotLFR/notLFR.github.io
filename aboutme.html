        <h1>About me</h1>
        <blockquote>Who Am I?</blockquote>
        <p>I'm Gannon O'Connor & this is a side project I've thrown together to document all of my ideas, inspirations,
            and the work I'm doing in addition to my school work</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote>Education?</blockquote>
        <p>I'm currently a senior at a pretty small college & I feel like due to the pandemic, my education was very
            limited, so I taught myself how to do some extra work in my free time during lockdown, and outside of class.
